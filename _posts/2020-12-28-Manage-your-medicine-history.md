Manage your medicine history


The most annoying imperfection in medicine system that we're facing to day in our digital world is the absence of
centralized storage to cover our medical history!

Do you remember which illness you went through as a child?

Do you remember if you had measles or chickenpox? If so, you can be safe near the person who ills.
But if not, you should be isolated from people who's infected by measles or chickenpox.

Do you know what allergic reaction you experienced as child?

Ok, we're talking about childhood. But even in adult life, we can't manage all our analysis in one place.
What was your blood indicators two year ago? If you had a treatment, you probably passed a lot of checks.
And there's no place to track it!

Some private clinics started to create "personal cabinet" for their patience. But you change you private clinic, you
can't transfer you data with analyses. Even inside one private practice, they can't keep all data and also they're loosing them sometimes!
Such a shame! 

In our modern world, there's a tendency to change a recidency and start living in the other country. Well, as we don't have an access to our midical history inside one country,
we couldn't even imagine for a system that's able to transfer all our medical data to the clinic in the other country.

I think it's something should fixed in next 10-20 years. I would like to hear about start-ups who's working on solution for it!
It's funny that I can already try to pass DNA test and find my predecessors for 1000 years ago but can't say what exactly was with my liver only 5 years ago!

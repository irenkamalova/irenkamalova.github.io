# Quality and quantities of our food

#### How many calories do we need to eat every day and what should they consist of? 

Food is a favorite subject for discussion in any company. Especially, if you meet new people from
 a foreign country with a different culture - you can talk a lot about food: what they used to
  eat for breakfast, for lunch, for dinner? How do they celebrate their holidays? Do they eat
   meat? Milk, cheese, lentils? Which fruits do they love?

I think that global industry achieved the top of abundance to offer the market food from any
 place on our planet. ANY PLACE! We can buy macadamia from Hawaii and lychee from Thailand while
  being in the UK.

But... **did we solve all problems with our food?** Obviously, not. People found a way to feed the
 enormous amount of the population. Almost every person in rich cities can consume 1.500-2.000 kcal per day. The problem of exceeding weight came with that new "consumption as lifestyle"! I see for now two problems in high light before mankind:
- sugar consumption
- meat consumption 
- food supplements

#### What's wrong with sugar?

Sugar is our next evil after drugs and nicotine. Itâ€™s no secret to anybody that sugar increases the
 level of glucose in the blood. As a result, it makes the brain become addicted to these high
 -glucose doses. It even can be a cause of degradation for a function to do a hard job for the
  human mind. But there's no evidence of this statement! 
The other thing about sugar: not all calories the same, and calories from sugar come to energy
 immediately. If you can't spend all this energy it goes to fats! It's always better to eat meat
  instead of sugar!

#### What's wrong with meat? 

Meat really shouldn't hurt balance in the human organism as sugar, sweets, salt, and other
 products with a high level of the [glycemic index](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/food-and-diet/what-is-the-glycaemic-index-gi/).
But here we have a problem of an absolutely different kind. According to research, [1 kg of meat
 cost the planet 25 kg of plants and 15.000 liters of water](http://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Report-48-WaterFootprint-AnimalProducts-Vol1_1.pdf).
That means breeds are high resource consumption to feed a massive population of people. How we should deal with it?

I don't think it's a signal to stop eating meat at all. Meat helped to develop our brains a lot, and
 literally made a man from a monkey. A simple example from wildlife: elephants eat plants and to
  feed themself they should chew and collect plants for their whole day. Every day. The lion can
   eat part of antelope and when lying, chilling, playing with lionesses. Meat gives animals
    enough energy and allows them no worry about food for a long time. An ancient man started to
     eat meat and obtain enough time to build new weapons, buildings, society, and grow humankind.
      In my opinion, the next step for people are growing meat in test-tubes. With all vitamins and
       minerals, proteins, complex fats, and amino acids we should obtain from meat. I want to point over here that it is necessary to obtain enough useful substances from food. For example, I don't eat enough red meat so I can't obtain enough iron to support a good level of hemoglobin. That's why I need to bring it as a supplement to my food.

#### What's wrong with food supplements?

I see two problems here:
- We don't have enough information about which supplements we need and which we don't need
- We don't have a good mechanism for everyday measurements of how our diet affects our body - do
 we obtain enough minerals and vitamins or do we need to exceed something?

I think that each person should start tracking nutrients as much as possible and food producers
 should put the information about nutrients as much as possible on labels and in centralized storage. The information should be easy to find by the bar code. Chronometer application already has done a lot of steps in this direction! https://cronometer.com/ 

#### Here is the step of digital technologies!
 Here are a lot of things that should be done: provide
 a big database for storing information about nutrition, help to put it in the one place for the person. A good example of such a place is Google or Apple account.

As I see it in the digital future: smart applications and accounts help you to track all
 nutritions you're consuming. It comes with information about the food you bought in a store. Your every
  check with groceries available to turn into nutrition table so you can easily found how many you're eating through the long period. That can be analyzed by AI and you could receive a personalized recommendation for your food-habits. What if you're eating outside or have a delivery from restaurants? We also can require improvements there: they can be asked to put all nutrients in every dish. This process expensive and take a long time. But it's possible to bring in our life, at least, after we will collect enough information from stores and food suppliers.

And only then we will have a good statistic for every person we can start health checks and massive comparisons for different groups of people. After all, it's possible to have enough data to prepare the solution for the sugar problem, for the meat problem, and create a personal recommendation of food supplements for every single person. 

**Data is our new oil!**
